## Notes:
- It is required to use dxlevel 90+ due to issues with ImGui.
- You might have issues with injecting if you are on Windows 10 upgraded from Windows 7.
- The source code is most likely __DETECTED__, use [VAC Bypass by danielkrupinski](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/VAC-Bypass). In the event you get VAC Banned, we are not responsible. Don't cheat on accounts you care about.
- Read the [Fedoraware Documentation](https://fedoraware.github.io/Docs/) to learn more about Fedoraware and its Features.

## Guide:
- We suggest using [Fedoraloader](https://github.com/lnx00/Fedoraloader/releases/) as it downloads the latest build and injects it with minimal crashing. It also includes VAC Bypass
- Alternatively, use an injector like [Xenos](https://github.com/relaxtakenotes/xenos) to inject the dll into TF2. [(Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT3kVA053IY)
- __If you have any problems, you can leave them - [Issues](https://github.com/tf2cheater2013/Fedoraware/issues)__ (Dear god please link a config and follow the issue template)
